# A "group" is a collection of worlds which will share an inventory.
#  In this example there are two groups, a creative and a survival group
#  Each group has an overworld and a nether, which will share an inventory

# groups:
#    creativegroup:
#    - creative_overworld
#    - creative_nether
#    survivalgroup:
#    - survival_overworld
#    - survival_nether
#    - survival_end

# Add a player to the "exempt" collection to make this plugin ignore them completely
#  No saves, loads or anything else done by this plugin will apply to them until you remove them from the list

# exempt:
#   - exampleplayer
#   - exampleplayer2

# Inventory switching examples
# Scenarios when the inventory will not switch:
#  creative_overworld to creative_nether
#  survival_nether to survival_overworld
#  survival_end to survival_overworld
# Scenarios when the inventory will switch:
#   creative_overworld to survival_end
#   survival_nether to creative_nether


# Set "store-player-stats" to true to make hearts, food level, experience and such track with inventory
# If a save interval is specified, set "log-saving-to-disk" to false to stop it from outputting to the console
# Set "save-interval" to anything above 30 to make inventories/stats save automatically every x seconds
# Set "load-inventory-on-login" to true to make the plugin load the player's inventory on login no matter where they spawn
# When this plugin loads it will automatically try to convert pre build 78 files and add "auto78updated: true" to this file if successful
# When this plugin loads it will automatically try to convert pre version 1.4.1 files and add "auto141updated: true" to this file if successful
# Set "perform-vanilla-import" to true to attempt an import of the items and stats stored in players player.dat file
# Set "vanilla-import-group" to the group you want to import to. If blank it will use the default group.
# Set "perform-game-mode-switches" to true and add groups to game modes as per the example to enforce game modes
#  SURVIVAL, CREATIVE or HARDCORE at the time of writing (follows Bukkit's names)

# game-modes:
#   default: SURVIVAL
#   creativegroup: CREATIVE
